    The file drop component provides an element to attach multiple files. It includes an option that users can select to browse for local files or use as a drop zone to drag and drop files. It also includes an option to provide hyperlinks to attach external files. You can leave the contents of the component blank to display the drop zone's default UI, or you can specify custom content to display instead.
    
    When the SKY UX module initializes, it disables the ability to drag and drop files for the entire window. This prevents the browser from opening files that are accidentally dropped outside the target zone. If you implement your own file drop functionality outside of the file drop component, you can place the sky-file-drop-target CSS class on the element that receives drop events to exempt it from the drop exclusion rule
